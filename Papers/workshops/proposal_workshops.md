This workshop aims to investigate the concept of intercorporeality as instruments within a co-located mixed reality gravitational field. Intercorporeality refers to the mutual interaction and influence between multiple bodies, and in this context, we explore its potential as a means of creative expression and collaboration in mixed reality environments. By leveraging the unique affordances of mixed reality technologies, participants will engage in hands-on activities and discussions to explore the intersections of physical and virtual bodies within a gravitational field.

Goals:

Examine the concept of intercorporeality: The workshop will provide a theoretical foundation for understanding intercorporeality and its implications within mixed reality environments. Participants will gain insights into the ways in which physical and virtual bodies can interact and influence each other, fostering a deeper understanding of the concept.

Explore embodied interactions in a mixed reality gravitational field: Participants will engage in practical exercises and experiments to explore the possibilities of intercorporeality in a co-located mixed reality gravitational field. Through guided activities, they will experience and analyze the ways in which their physical movements and gestures can shape and be shaped by virtual elements within the gravitational field.

Foster interdisciplinary collaboration: The workshop aims to bring together participants from diverse backgrounds, including artists, designers, technologists, and researchers, to foster interdisciplinary collaboration. By working together and sharing perspectives, participants will explore new ideas and approaches to intercorporeality within mixed reality environments.

Reflect on ethical and social implications: As mixed reality technologies continue to evolve, it is crucial to consider the ethical and social implications of intercorporeality. The workshop will provide a platform for participants to engage in critical discussions and reflection on topics such as privacy, consent, and the impact of mixed reality experiences on the physical and virtual bodies involved.

Context:

The workshop is designed for participants with an interest in the intersection of art, design, and technology, particularly within the realm of mixed reality experiences. It is relevant to practitioners and researchers in fields such as interactive media, virtual reality, augmented reality, human-computer interaction, and digital arts. By bringing together a diverse group of participants, the workshop aims to facilitate knowledge exchange and collaboration across disciplines.

The concept of intercorporeality as instruments within a co-located mixed reality gravitational field is at the forefront of current technological advancements. As mixed reality technologies become more accessible and sophisticated, there is a growing interest in exploring the potential of embodied interactions and collaborative experiences. This workshop aims to contribute to this emerging field by providing a platform for participants to experiment, reflect, and collectively shape the discourse around intercorporeality within mixed reality environments.

The workshop format will include a combination of presentations, hands-on activities, group discussions, and reflections. Participants will have the opportunity to engage with cutting-edge mixed reality technologies and explore their creative potential within a safe and supportive environment. The outcomes of the workshop will contribute to the broader understanding of intercorporeality, fostering innovation and inspiring new directions for research, design, and artistic practices within the field of mixed reality.

"Gravitational Field" is an immersive live performance that explores the concept of intercorporeality through the unique medium of live coding and co-located mixed reality. In this experience, the boundaries between the physical and virtual worlds blur, creating a captivating environment where performers and participants become co-creators of an interactive sonic and visual landscape. Drawing inspiration from gravitational forces, the performance leverages live coding techniques to manipulate and generate audiovisual elements in real-time. Performers embody the role of both musicians and programmers, using their bodies as instruments to control and shape the evolving digital universe. Through this co-located mixed reality experience, "Gravitational Field" invites the audience to engage their senses and actively participate in the creation of an ever-shifting sonic and visual narrative. The performance challenges traditional notions of musical composition and performance, offering a mesmerizing exploration of intercorporeality, where human performers and digital instruments converge in a harmonious blend of artistry and technology.
