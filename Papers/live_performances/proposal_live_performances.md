# ICLC 2024 - Proposal for Live Performances

Live Performances (including audio, visual, and A/V or multimedia) will largely be sorted into one of two formats: a concert format, with seated audience; and an Algorave format, unseated and intended for dancing.

## 4. Program Note

"Gravitational Field" is an immersive live performance that explores the concept of intercorporeality through the unique medium of live coding and co-located mixed reality. In this experience, the boundaries between the physical and virtual worlds blur, creating a captivating environment where performers and participants become co-creators of an interactive sonic and visual landscape. Drawing inspiration from gravitational forces, the performance leverages live coding techniques to manipulate and generate audiovisual elements in real-time. Performers embody the role of both musicians and programmers, using their bodies as instruments to control and shape the evolving digital universe. Through this co-located mixed reality experience, "Gravitational Field" invites the audience to engage their senses and actively participate in the creation of an ever-shifting sonic and visual narrative. The performance challenges traditional notions of musical composition and performance, offering a mesmerizing exploration of intercorporeality, where human performers and digital instruments converge in a harmonious blend of artistry and technology.
